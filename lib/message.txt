# To save a princess

_Village of Orange_
There was a quiet village known as Orange. Many people resided within this village and paid their taxes to the King of the realm.


Things seemed to be going great for the Kingdom until recent events. In The Village of Orange you've been noticing posters asking for help to get someone back. Who is this person? Well, it was the princess of the realm. Her name was Princess Chadley.






_Village of Orange_

You notice the reward for Princess Chadley is a substantial amount. If you decide to embark on this journey you may not only get showered in riches, you may even get to spend time with the very beautiful Princess Chadley. You've heard that her beauty is so powerful it has stopped men in their tracks.

_Reward_
It was no mystery who kidnapped the princess. Captured thugs who were interrogated revealed they were working for the infamous Captain Consalvi. A known leader of a group of thugs looking to make mad cash anyway they can. Everybody knows Captain Consalvi's headquarters is located a few towns over. Getting inside is nearly impossible unless you're part of the crew.

_What to do next?_

* Go to the local Breh for wisdom
 
  You seek out the village Breh. These are wise masters of the universe in which people go to with questions. As you enter the wooden shack you stop at the entrance to see the Breh. The inside of the shack is dark except for where he is sitting. A beam of light is somehow illuminating down onto him. He is staring right at you with intimidating eyes. He seems like he wants to fight.
  **goto breh**
 

* Seek out your friends to see if they'll go with you
 
  You look around for a bit and spot them across the courtyard.
  **goto friends**
  
_Da Breh_(#breh)

* Walk Forward

  The Breh says,"I did not say you could...but you may approach." Feeling annoyed by his tone you continue on. "My name is Papa Kurtis." He bows and says," Shaka da Breh." This must be a greeting at the academy of the Breh. "Many people have tried and failed already to save the voluptuous Chadley. You've already made the right choice of coming to me first." He hands you two Teir 2 loot. You walk out to then go look for your friends.

You really don't feel like wasting your time with that creep. You seek out your group of friends.

You all wake up to the sound of approaching footsteps. Grab your weapons and prepare to fight!

_Victory!_ (#victory)

The fact the Vampire is gone is a victory in it of itself. The group continues on but some still were thinking about which 'suck' the Vampire meant.

_Continuing on_
The group continues on the path the next day. They pass a side road that leads to a shack that reads "Travelers welcome". It seems kinda like a trap.



* The group walks to the shack
 
  
  When you walk in there is a lonely woman sitting behind a counter. She looks up and is ecstatic to actually see somebody. "My oh my, I haven't had people walk in for a while! My name is Alyak." 
  
  The owner treats the group to hot meals and mead all night.The party drank a little too much and as a result all party members take 2 damage.
  
  Before everybody walks out, Alyak hands out souvenirs. All members draws a tier 1 loot.

  Who knows what weirdo helps out strangers.
