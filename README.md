# MockBot: Your Interactive Discord Companion
MockBot is a delightful and convenient Discord bot that I've been developing as a personal project. Its purpose is to bring a wide range of enjoyable and practical utilities to your Discord server, enhancing interactivity and user-friendliness.

Currently, MockBot operates efficiently on a Raspberry Pi 4 running Raspbian, showcasing its ability to function seamlessly on minimal hardware.

## Setup and Configuration
To use MockBot on your server, you'll need to set up a .env file in the project root directory, containing your Discord token, Tenor API key, and ChatGPT API key. The structure of the file should be as follows:
<br>
TOKEN = your-discord-token-here 
<br>
CLIENT = your-key-here
<br>
TENORKEY = your-tenor-api-key-here
<br>
GPT = your-chatgpt-api-key-here
<br>

    
## Contributions and Feedback
Feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit pull requests. Contributions are always welcome! If you prefer to use the bot as-is, you can simply invite it to your server.

Your feedback is valuable! It helps us improve the bot and address any hidden issues. Therefore, we greatly appreciate your thoughts and suggestions.

Let's enhance our Discord servers with the entertaining and engaging MockBot!
