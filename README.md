# MockBot
                My discord bot is a fun side projcet I work on to add fun and useful tools for my discord server.
                I am currently running my discord bot off of a Raspberry Pi 4 running raspbian.
                Feel free to fork off of my repo or invite the bot to your server.
                A .env file is need with your discord token and tenor api key.
                Feedback is always great!
