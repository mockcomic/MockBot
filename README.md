# MockBot
MockBot is an enjoyable and handy Discord bot I've been developing as a side project. It's designed to introduce an array of fun and practical utilities to your Discord server, making it more interactive and user-friendly.

Currently, MockBot operates on a Raspberry Pi 4 running Raspbian, demonstrating its efficiency and capability to run on minimal hardware.

## Setup and Configuration
For using MockBot in your server, you need a .env file in your project root with your Discord token and Tenor API key. The structure should look like this:
    ```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your-discord-token-here
TENOR_KEY=your-tenor-api-key-here
    ```

## Contributions and Feedback
Feel free to fork the repo, make changes, and propose pull requests. Contributions are always welcome. If you just want to use the bot as it is, you're more than welcome to invite it to your server!

Your feedback matters! It helps in making the bot better and fixing any lurking bugs. So, your thoughts and suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Let's make our Discord servers more fun and engaging with MockBot!
